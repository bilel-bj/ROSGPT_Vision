**Robotics and Internet of Things Lab (RIOTU Lab), Prince Sultan University, Saudi Arabia**

Inspired by  [ROSGPT](https://github.com/aniskoubaa/rosgpt). Both projects aim to bridge the gap between robotics, natural language understanding, and image analysis. 

Collaborators who want to participate in this project, are very welcome. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **ROSGPT_Vision** is a new robotic framework dsigned to command robots using only two prompts:
	- a **Visual Prompt** (for visual semantic features), and
 	- an **LLM Prompt** (to regulate robotic reactions).
- It is based on a new robotic design pattern: **Prompting Robotic Modalities (PRM)**.
- **ROSGPT_Vision** is used to develop **CarMate**, a robotic application for  monitoring driver distractions and providing real-time vocal notifications. It showcases cost-effective development.
- We demonstrated how to optimize the prompting strategies to improve the application.
- LangChain framework is used by to easily customize prompts.
- More details are described in the academic paper "ROSGPT_Vision: Commanding Robots using only Language Models' Prompts".

## Overview

**ROSGPT_Vision** offers a unified platform that allows robots to perceive, interpret, and interact with visual data through natural language. The framework leverages state-of-the-art language models, including [LLAVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA), [MiniGPT-4](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4), and [Caption-Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything), to facilitate advanced reasoning about image data. [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) is used for easy customization of the prompts. The provided implementation includes the **CarMate** application, a driver monitoring and assistance system designed to ensure safe and efficient driving experiences.

## Prompting Robotic Modalities (PRM) Design Pattern
- A new design approach emphasizing modular and individualized sensory queries.
- Uses specific **Modality Language Models (MLM)** for textual interpretations of inputs, like the **Vision Language Model (VLM)** for visual data.
- Ensures precise data collection by treating each sensory input separately.
- **Task Modality**'s Role: Serves as the central coordinator, synthesizing data from various modalities.

## CarMate Application
**CarMate** is a complete application for monitoring driver behavior which was developed  just by setting two prompts in the YAML file. It automatically analyses the input video using the Visual prompt, analyses what should be done using the LLM prompt, and gives an instant alert to the driver when needed. 

These are the prompts used to develop the application, without needing extra code: 

**The Visual prompt:**

	Visual prompt: "Describe the driver’s current level of focus 
 	on driving based on the visual cues, Answer with one short sentence."

**The LLM prompt:**

	LLM prompt:"Consider the following ontology: You must write your Reply 
 	with one short sentence. Behave as a carmate that surveys the driver 
  	and gives him advice and instruction to drive safely. You will be given 
   	human language prompts describing an image. Your task is to provide 
    	appropriate instructions to the driver based on the description."

We can see three examples of scenarios, got during the driving: 

### Scenario 1: The driver is using phone
We can see in the top box the description generated by the image semantics module for the input image using the Visual prompt. 
Meanwhile, the second box generates the alert that should be given to the driver using the LLM prompt.

### Scenario 2: The driver is taking pictures

### Scenario 3: The driver is drinking

## Installation
#### To use ROSGPT_Vision, follow these steps:
**1. Prepare the code and the environment**

  Git clone our repository, creating a python environment and ativate it via the following command

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ROSGPT_Vision.git
  git clone https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4.git rosgpt_vision
  git clone https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA.git rosgpt_vision
  cd ROSGPT_Vision
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate ROSGPT_Vision
```



**2. Install the required dependencies**

- You can run image_semantics.py by install all required dependencies from [LLAVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA), [MiniGPT-4](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4) and [Caption-Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything).

- Ensure the installation of all requisite dependencies for ROS2.
